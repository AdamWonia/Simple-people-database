# Simple people database

Simple people database is a program that allows you to add people to a 
folder selected by the user.

The user can select 3 types of people: Employee, Student and Child
and fill in basic and additional information about each person.

After entering the data, the user has the opportunity to save the person to a selected
folder, in which the file 'person_details.txt' is created, containing data entered by the user.

Apart from the option of adding a new person, there is a possibility to rename or delete
existing folder.

The program can be further developed, for example, by adding more types of people, 
additional information, the possibility of editing information about an existing person, adding
persons to the internet database, etc.

File classes.py contains classes of people with appropriate fields and methods.
File functions.py contains the created functions that are used in the program.
File main.py constitutes the main file that is run.

The author assumes no responsibility for accidental deletion or renaming of
an important folder to the user. Please be careful when using this program.
